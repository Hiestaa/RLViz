# RLViz
A webapp based on tornado, gym and visjs for reinforcement learning algorithms visualisation

## Goal

The project is still in its very early phase, do not expect to see anything useful here within several months.
The goal is to implement several reinforcement learning algorithms, 
from the simplest non-approximated Monte Carlo value-function learning to more advanced SARSA, Q-learning using 
value function approximation, policy gradient, actor-critics or even model-based algorithms.

The work has been inspired by the excellent Reinforcement Learning course by David Silver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItMutbeOHtc&index=8&list=PL7-jPKtc4r78-wCZcQn5IqyuWhBZ8fOxT&spfreload=1

## Updates

### Initial Commit: 23/12/2015 

Experiments with gym on simplest existing problem. First implementation of an RL algorithm ever.
